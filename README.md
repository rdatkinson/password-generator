# password-generator

## Description
This project is a random password generator, that allows the end user to generate a random, secure password that includes uppercase, lowercase, numeric and special characters, that has to be a minimum of 8 characters but no more than 128 characters. You can access the app using this link: https://rdatkinson.github.io/password-generator/

## Installation
N/A

## Usage
The user should click the "generate password" button on the webpage. They will be prompted to type in the amount of characters they would like their password to have. They will then be presented with a series of prompts, which they should answer "yes" or "no" to, which will ask them if they would like their password to have uppercase, lowercase, numeric and special characters.

Once they have completed all the prompts, they will end up with a password that they can copy and paste. They will end up with something similar to the screenshot below - for reference, I have included the first prompt in the screenshot, along with a password that I generated previously to show the functionality of the app.
